
### **Explanation of the Styling:**
1. **Headings (`#`, `##`)**: 
   - `#` is used for the main heading (project name).
   - `##` is used for subheadings like "Docker Commands" and "Instructions to Deploy on Render".

2. **Code Blocks (` ``` `)**: 
   - Wrap the Docker commands and other code snippets in triple backticks to highlight them as code blocks.

3. **Bold Text (`**`)**: 
   - Used for emphasizing key instructions, like "Create a repository on GitHub".

4. **Bullet Points (`-`)**: 
   - Used to list the steps for deploying on Render.

This structure will display cleanly in your GitHub `README.md` file, making it easy to follow for anyone reading it.
