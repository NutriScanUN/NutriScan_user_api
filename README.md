
### **Explanation of the Markdown structure:**

- **# NutriScan_user_api**: The project title, styled as a primary header.
- **## Commands to Docker Compile and Run**: A subheader for Docker instructions.
- **Code blocks**: Enclosed in triple backticks (` ```bash `) to display the Docker commands as executable code.
- **## Instructions to Deploy on Render**: A subheader for deployment instructions.
- **Ordered list**: Numbered steps are provided for the Render deployment process.
- **Inline code**: Code like `PORT` is written in backticks for clarity.
- **Notes section**: An extra section at the end with additional helpful information.

This will give your `README.md` a clean and organized structure when viewed on GitHub or any other Markdown renderer.
